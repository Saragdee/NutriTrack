    <h1>Dietary Recommendations</h1>

    <!-- Example Dietary Recommendations -->
    <p>For a balanced diet, it's important to include a variety of nutrient-rich foods in your meals. Here are some general dietary recommendations:</p>
    <div id="foodResults"></div>
    <ul>
        <li>Eat a diverse range of fruits and vegetables daily to obtain essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.</li>
        <li>Incorporate whole grains like brown rice, whole wheat, oats, and quinoa into your diet for fiber and sustained energy.</li>
        <li>Include lean sources of protein such as poultry, fish, beans, tofu, and nuts for muscle repair and growth.</li>
        <li>Consume foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids like salmon, chia seeds, and flaxseeds for heart health and brain function.</li>
        <li>Consider taking supplements like vitamin D, especially if you have limited sun exposure, and omega-3 fish oil for overall health support.</li>
        <li>Minerals such as magnesium and zinc may become deficient due to stress; consider foods like nuts, seeds, legumes, and leafy greens rich in these nutrients.</li>
        <li>When physically active, ensure adequate intake of electrolytes (potassium, sodium, magnesium) through foods like bananas, sweet potatoes, and nuts, or electrolyte-enhanced beverages for hydration and muscle function.</li>
        <li>Avoid excessive consumption of processed foods, sugary drinks, and high-fat snacks, as they often contain added sugars, unhealthy fats, and excessive sodium.</li>
        <li>Maintain hydration by drinking plenty of water throughout the day; consider coconut water or sports drinks during prolonged physical activity to replenish electrolytes.</li>
        <li>Control portion sizes to maintain a healthy weight and prevent overeating.</li>
        <li>Always consider your individual dietary needs, any specific health conditions, and consult a registered dietitian or healthcare professional for personalized dietary advice.</li>
        <li>Consume a variety of colored fruits and vegetables to ensure a broad spectrum of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.</li>
        <li>Include probiotic-rich foods like yogurt, kefir, kimchi, or sauerkraut to support gut health and digestion.</li>
        <li>Opt for healthy fats found in avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil for heart health and nutrient absorption.</li>
        <li>Consider incorporating turmeric, garlic, ginger, and other herbs/spices known for their anti-inflammatory properties into your diet.</li>
        <li>Ensure adequate intake of calcium-rich foods like dairy products, leafy greens, and fortified plant-based milk for bone health.</li>
        <li>Include iron-rich foods such as lean meats, beans, lentils, and dark leafy greens to prevent iron-deficiency anemia.</li>
        <li>Consume foods high in vitamin C (citrus fruits, bell peppers) to enhance iron absorption from plant-based sources.</li>
        <li>Monitor sodium intake and aim to limit high-sodium foods like processed meats, canned soups, and salty snacks.</li>
        <li>Emphasize mindful eating practices, chewing slowly, and savoring meals to aid digestion and prevent overeating.</li>
        <li>Practice moderation and balance; avoid restrictive diets and aim for a sustainable, enjoyable approach to eating.</li>
